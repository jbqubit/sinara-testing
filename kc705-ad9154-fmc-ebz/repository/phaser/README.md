# This folder contains acceptance tests for the Smart Arbitrary Waveform Generator (SAWG) conducted in July 2017. 

The Sayma two-tone (SAWG) gateware was prototyped on the KC705 as a project code named 'phaser'. An automated script that runs the acceptance testes is [here](https://github.com/jbqubit/sinara-testing/blob/master/kc705-ad9154-fmc-ebz/repository/phaser/test_suite.py).
